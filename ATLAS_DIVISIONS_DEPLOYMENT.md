### ðŸ”„ For Full Production Deployment

To deploy the complete Three.js homepage, you have two options:

#### Option A: Embed in Worker (Current)
The current implementation includes a simplified homepage in the worker. For the full Three.js experience, you would need to:

1. **Embed Full HTML**: Replace the simple homepage in `getHomepageHTML()` with the complete content from `static/index.html`
2. **Deploy**: Use `npm run deploy`

#### Option B: Use Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)
For better performance with static assets:

1. **Deploy static files** to Cloudflare Pages
2. **Keep worker** for form processing only
3. **Configure routing** to serve static content from Pages

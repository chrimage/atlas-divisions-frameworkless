# EPIC: Migrate Contact Form from Cloudflare Email Routing to Mailgun

## Overview
**Epic ID**: MAIL-001  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

## Problem Statement
Client's DNS requirements conflict between Cloudflare email routing and existing Zoho services. Current email routing solution prevents client from maintaining their existing email infrastructure.

## Business Impact
- **Risk**: Client cannot deploy due to DNS conflicts
- **Opportunity**: More flexible email solution with better deliverability
- **User Impact**: Improved email delivery and reliability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Contact form emails delivered successfully via Mailgun
- [ ] No DNS conflicts with client's Zoho setup
- [ ] Maintain current form functionality and user experience
- [ ] Email delivery metrics/tracking available
- [ ] Clean removal of Cloudflare email routing dependencies

## Technical Scope

### In Scope
- Mailgun API integration for email sending
- Update contact form email handling logic
- Environment configuration for Mailgun credentials
- Update deployment configurations
- Remove Cloudflare email routing code/config
- Testing email delivery in dev/staging environments

### Out of Scope
- Changes to contact form UI/UX
- Email template redesign (unless required for Mailgun)
- Advanced email analytics/dashboard

## Stories & Tasks
1. **Research & Planning**
   - Mailgun API capabilities assessment
   - DNS requirements analysis
   - Migration strategy document

2. **Implementation**
   - Mailgun SDK integration
   - Email service refactoring
   - Configuration updates
   - Testing framework updates

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Email delivery testing

   - Documentation updates

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Mailgun API rate limits
  - *Mitigation*: Review limits, implement queuing if needed
- **Risk**: Email deliverability issues
  - *Mitigation*: Proper DNS setup, domain verification
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - *Mitigation*: POC first, incremental implementation

## Dependencies
